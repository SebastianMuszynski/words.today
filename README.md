Learn new vocabulary with ease!

## The idea
Being fluent in a foreign language means knowing its grammar and lots of vocabulary. The main goal of the project is to focus on the latter — to help to learn and memorise new words and their meaning.

## Setup

1. Make sure to have NodeJS installed.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm build` or run a watcher by `npm watch`.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. Open `http://localhost:8080`.
